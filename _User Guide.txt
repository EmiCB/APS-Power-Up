Steps:
1. go into the PowerUp.js file
2. find "//AUTOS HERE" (line 440 right now)
3. change values or make new paths

Stuff:
- All measurements are in inches and degrees
- Each j case is an auto, each i case is a step of auto
- Positions are scale, switch robot as of right now (ex. 'LRC' = left scale, right switch, center start)

- case 2 works best rn
